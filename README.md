# Code for Multimodal Bandits: Regret Lower Bounds and Optimal Algorithms

This repository contains the Python code used for the runtime and regret experiments in the paper. 

## Code Structure
➤ The code is organized in this order:
1) Helpful auxiliary functions
2) Main DP algorithm
3) Improved DP algorithm (see Appendix E in the paper)
4) Subgradient descent procedure
5) OSSB implementation
6) Experiments from the paper
   
➤ The flags RUNTIME_EXPERIMENT, RUNTIME_IMPROVED_DP_EXPERIMENT and REGRET_EXPERIMENT can be set to True to run the experiments of Appendix A.2, Appendix E.8 and Section 6 respectively.

All functions have a docstring, and a documentation is found in folder "docs".
